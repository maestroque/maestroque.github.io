During the summer of 2024, I had the chance to become a Google Summer of Code student, contributing in the [Physiopy](https://physiopy.github.io/) community, under the [INCF](https://www.incf.org/) organization. In this page, which is also serving as my Work Product Submission for finalizing my GSoC participation, the project will be presented, how it progressed during the summer and what future directions it could take. Emphasis is going to be given to the development breakdown, the rationale of all the contributions and the main ideas for future development.
